# Brain-MRI-Segmentation-using-Deep-Learning
This repository explores the use of deep learning-based segmentation of brain tumor MRI scans to extract shape features predictive of genomic subtypes in lower-grade gliomas. The code and documentation provide a guide to developing quantitative imaging biomarkers as surrogates for molecular characterization of gliomas.
